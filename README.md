🏆 About Rankkatsu

Rankkatsu is more than just a ranking website; it is a dynamic community platform designed to settle the age-old question: "Which one is the best?"

Whether it is debating the greatest athletes of all time, ranking the best video game soundtracks, or deciding on the ultimate comfort food, Rankkatsu provides the arena where subjective opinions are transformed into community-driven data.

🎌 The Meaning Behind the Name

The name Rankkatsu is a linguistic fusion that embodies the spirit of our platform:

"Rank": The core functionality—ordering items based on quality or preference.

"Katsu" (勝): Derived from the Japanese word for "Victory" or "To Win."

Together, Rankkatsu symbolizes the activity of finding the winner. It represents the journey of filtering through the noise to crown the true champion of any category through collective voting.

🗳️ How It Works

Unlike static lists, Rankkatsu is alive. Users can create custom rankings using images and YouTube videos, but the real magic happens in the voting process. We utilize a dual-system approach:

Direct Ranking: Users drag and drop items to create their personal tier lists.

Matchmaking Duels: Items face off in battles, allowing our algorithms to determine a precise, unbiased hierarchy based on community consensus.

🛠️ Technology Stack

Rankkatsu is built on the VILT Stack, a modern architectural choice that combines the robustness of a PHP monolith with the interactivity of a Single Page Application (SPA).

Backend: Powered by Laravel, ensuring enterprise-grade security, efficient database management via MySQL, and seamless handling of complex logic like voting algorithms and user authentication.

Frontend: Built with Vue.js and Tailwind CSS, delivering a reactive, dark-mode-ready, and aesthetically pleasing user interface that feels like a native app.

The Glue: Inertia.js bridges the gap between server and client, allowing us to build a fully modern frontend without the complexity of a separate API, keeping development fast and maintainable.

Ecosystem: The platform integrates Stripe for handling monthly and lifetime Premium subscriptions, Google AdSense for monetization, and i18n support for different languages, making Rankkatsu a truly global experience.
